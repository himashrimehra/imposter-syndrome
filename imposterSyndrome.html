<h1>Overcoming Imposter Syndrome</h1>
<p>
"Mirror, mirror on the wall. Am I worthy of this all?"
</p>
<div>Have you ever felt like you don't actually deserve your achievements, or that you are not competent enough for what you have accomplished? If that sounds unsettlingly familiar, then you are not alone.</div>
<br>
<div>These feelings are called an imposter phenomenon by the psychologists. According to an article written by Kevin Dickinson, about 75% of women executives have experienced imposter syndrome and believe they put more pressure on themselves to succeed than men. 
"It's important to realize that most women experience similar doubts at some point in our careers," Laura Newinski, KPMG's COO, said in the same release. "Our contribution as leaders is pivotal. Together, we have the opportunity to build corporate environments that foster a sense of belonging and lessen the experience of imposter syndrome for women in our workplaces.</div>
<br>
<h2>What is Imposter Syndrome?</h2>
<br>
<div>
An article written by Melanie Clark describes imposter syndrome as an observed anxiety caused by an individual's feelings of fraudulence, fear of being exposed as a fraud, and inability to internalize personal achievement. Today, impostor syndrome can apply to anyone "who isn't able to internalize and own their successes," says psychologist Audrey Ervin.
<br>
First described by psychologists Suzanne Imes, PhD, and Pauline Rose Clance, PhD, in the 1970s, impostor phenomenon occurs among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success. Most of the time, they attribute their accomplishments to luck rather than to ability and fear that others will eventually unmask them as a fraud. Anyone can be affected by imposter syndrome, regardless of job or social status, but high-achieving individuals often experience it.
<br>
Here's how the impostor syndrome expert Valerie Young, who is the author of a book on the subject, The Secret Thoughts of Successful Women, describes the patterns in people who experience impostor feelings:
<ul>
<li>"Perfectionists" set extremely high expectations for themselves, and even if they meet 99% of their goals, they tend to feel like failures. Any small mistake will make them question their own competence.</li>
<li>"Experts" feel the need to know every piece of information before they start a project and constantly look for new certifications or training to improve their skills. They won't apply for a job if they don't meet all the criteria in the posting, and they might be hesitant to ask a question in class or speak up in a meeting at work because they're afraid of looking stupid if they don't already know the answer.
When the "natural genius" has to struggle or work hard to accomplish something, he or she thinks this means they aren't good enough. They are used to skills coming easily, and when they have to put in effort, their brain tells them that's proof they're an impostor.</li>
<li>"Soloists" feel they have to accomplish tasks on their own, and if they need to ask for help, they think that means they are a failure or a fraud.</li>
<li>"Supermen" or "superwomen" push themselves to work harder than those around them to prove that they're not impostors. They feel the need to succeed in all aspects of life-at work, as parents, as partners-and may feel stressed when they are not accomplishing something.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>What causes the people to experience impostor syndrome?</h2>
<br>
<div>
There are certain factors that can contribute to the more general experience of impostor syndrome. For example, you might have come from a family that highly valued achievements or had parents who flipped back and forth between offering praise and being critical. Sometimes memories of childhood, such as feeling that your grades were never good enough for your parents or that your siblings outshone you in certain areas, can leave a lasting impact.
<br>
Entering a new role can also trigger impostor syndrome. For example, taking admission in a college or university might leave you feeling as if you don't belong and are not capable.
<br>
Factors outside of a person, such as institutionalized discrimination or the environment can also play a major role in giving rise to feeling like an impostor. According to a psychologist, Young, "A sense of belonging fosters confidence. The more people who look or sound like you, the more confident you feel. And conversely, the fewer people who look or sound like you, it can and does for many people impact their confidence. This is especially true whenever you belong to a group for whom there are stereotypes about competence, including racial or ethnic minorities, women in STEM fields or even international students at American universities."

<h2>Here's how to deal with it.</h2>

<div>
In order to move past these feelings, you need to become comfortable confronting some of those deep-rooted beliefs that you hold about yourself. This can be tough because you might not even realize that you hold them, but here is a list of some techniques that you can use:
<ul>
<li><b>Question your thoughts:</b> Acknowledge your thoughts and put them in perspective. Ask yourself questions like- Does that thought help or hinder me? or does it make sense that you are a fraud, given everything that you know?</li>
<li><b>Share your feelings:</b> It can also be helpful to share what you're feeling with trusted friends or mentors. These unreasonable beliefs tend to get worse when they are concealed and not talked about. Those who have far more experience can reassure you that what you're feeling is completely normal, and knowing others have been through similar situations can make it seem less scary.</li>
<li><b>Avoid comparisons:</b> Every time you compare yourself to others in a social gathering or situation, you will find some fault with yourself that encourages the feeling of incompetence or not being good enough. Instead focus on listening to what the other person is saying during discussions. Be genuinely interested in learning more.</li>
<li><b>Evaluate your abilities:</b> If you feel incompetent in social and performance situations, draft a realistic assessment of your abilities. Jot down your accomplishments and what you are good at, and compare that with your self-analysis.</li>
<li><b>Focus on others:</b> This might seem implausible, but try to help others facing the same situation as you. If you come across someone who seems awkward or alone, ask that person a question to bring them into the group. Once you start practicing your skills, you will gradually build confidence in your own abilities.</li>
<li><b>Take baby steps:</b> Don't push yourself into doing things perfectly, rather, do things reasonably well and reward yourself for taking action. In a group conversation, offer your opinion, make decisions and share a story about yourself.</li>
<li><b>Refuse to let it hold you back:</b> Even if you greatly feel like you don't belong, don't let that stop you from pursuing your goals. Keep going and refuse to be stopped.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Remember that if you constantly feel like an impostor, it means you have some degree of success in your life that you are simply attributing to luck. Instead, try to change that thought into one of gratitude. Be mindful of what you have accomplished in your life and be grateful.
Don't sabotage yourself by your fear of being found out. Start the self-compassion and let others see the real you. If you have attempted all these things and still feel that your feeling of being an impostor is holding you back, it is important to speak to a mental health professional.</div>
